# weather-local
# Project "Local", weather forecast.

### In this project I used:
1. Html
2. Css
3. JavaScript
4. Openweathermap API

### What this project can do:
1. Displaying city cards, with weather, how the weather feels, humidity, wind speed, weather icon, and weather description, city name.
2. When you first enter the site, you are initially given the city I specified.
3. You can delete cities.
4. You can add cities.
5. The project saves the cities you need in local memory. That is, the next time you enter the site, they will also be on the page.
6. If errors occur, the project displays a modal window with a description of the error to the user.
